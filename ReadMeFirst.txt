Restful webservice demo appplication using jersey, spring and hibernate.

Here I have created two demo services for getting locations and for saving data to db.

Before running service, firstly change some configurations for the database in applicationcontext.xml like db url and user-pass.

For testing use the url defined in the client package.

Thanks!!

Happy coding!!
